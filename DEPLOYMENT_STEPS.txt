DEPLOYMENT TO STACKCP (REPLACING WORDPRESS)
===========================================

1. CLEANUP
   - Go to your StackCP File Manager -> public_html
   - Select ALL files (WordPress files) and DELETE them.
   - (Optional) Keep a backup of wp-config.php if you might need database credentials later.

2. UPLOAD
   - On your local computer, open:
     c:\Users\User\Desktop\haseeb-services-website-main\out
   - Select ALL files and folders inside 'out'.
   - Drag and drop them into the empty 'public_html' folder in StackCP.

3. VERIFY
   - Go to your domain in a browser.
   - You should see the new Next.js site!

Troubleshooting:
- If you see a white screen, check the browser console (F12) for errors.
- Ensure you uploaded the *contents* of 'out', not the 'out' folder itself.
